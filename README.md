# City Scrapers St. Louis

## What are the City Scrapers and why do we want them?

Public meetings are important spaces for democracy where any resident can participate and hold public figures accountable. But how does the public know when meetings are happening? It isnâ€™t easy! These events are spread across dozens of websites, rarely in useful data formats.

## Our Mission

The mission of the City Scrapers project is to increase access and transparency around public meetings across the St. Louis County by making it easier for everyone to know when and where public meetings are held.

## Contributing

We welcome both coders and non-coders to help out with our project!
